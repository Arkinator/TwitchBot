#My Twitch Bot
It's pretty basic at the moment, but my goal is for it to do everything I want it to do. (NOTE: It's not ready to be used in production atm. You've been warned ;)

###Installation/Usage
 1. Download the source code
 2. Modify `config.example.properties` as per the instructions in the file
 3. Run it

Eventually, I'll publish a well-documented release .jar and a init.d service script, but the bot isn't nearly close to being finished, so no need to do that yet.

Please [open an issue](https://github.com/zzzanderw/TwitchBot/issues) if there are any bugs, glaring style issues, or if you have an idea for a feature.
